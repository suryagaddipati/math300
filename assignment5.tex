\newtheorem*{KL}{Theorem }

\begin{KL} 
Given a positive integer $n$, suppose $S$ is a subset of \{$1$, $2$,...,$2n$\} with $|S| = n + 1$. Prove that there are distinct $a$,$b$ in $S$ such that $a$ divides $b$.
\end{KL}
\begin{proof}
  Notice that any integer can be written {\bf uniquely}  as $k.2^q$ where $k$ is an odd number less than  $k.2^q$ and $q$ is any iteger.\\
  Set \{$1$, $2$,...,$2n$\} contains $n$ odd itegers. 
  If we write each integer $r$ as $k.2^q$ where $k$ is an odd number less than  $r$ and $q$ is any iteger.\\ 
  Since there are only $n$ odd integers  and $S$ contains $n+1$ elements, there are two integers in $S$ that share an odd number when written in $k.2^q$ form. If $a$ and $b$ are two such integers in $S$ then we can say that either $a|b$ or $b|a$ .


\end{proof}
