\(\sqrt 2\) is irrational

Lets assume that \(\sqrt 2\) is rational, meaning it can be expressed as

\[\sqrt{2} = \frac{a}{b}\]

where \(a\) and \(b\) are real numbers.
This implies,

\[2 = \frac{a^2}{b^2}\]

\[\label{eq:solve}
    2b^2 = a^2\]

Thus \(a^2\) is an even number which means \(a\) is an even number, since squares of even numbers are even numbers. Since \(a\) is an even number there exists a number \(c\) such that

\[a= 2c\]

Substituting, \(c\) in  [eq:solve] we get

\[2b^2 = (2c)^2\]

\[2b^2 = 4c^2\]

\[\label{eq:biseven}
    b^2 = 2c^2\]

Equation  [eq:biseven] implies that \(b\) is an even number too. This means that \(a\) and \(b\) have a common factor of \(2\), but \(a\) and \(b\) shouldn’t have any common factors.
We have a contradiction. Hence \(\sqrt 2\) is irrational.
